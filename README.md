# archive.NIMH_SOIN
This repository was created to accompany my transition documents when I left the Berman Lab on 6/15/16. All folders in this repository correspond to data pipelines or projects I created while working at NIH. This will both be an archive for myself to reference in the future and be a reference for Bermanites to reproduce or continue some of the projects I worked on.
